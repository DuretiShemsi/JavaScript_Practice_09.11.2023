        //Exercise #7
        //As a challenge, design a Library class. This class should be able to store book objects.
        //For book objects, you should have a Book class. This class should have private fields for ISBN and public fields like title, author, and yearPublished.
        //The Library should feature methods that allow a user to add a book, remove a book, and list all books.
        //Implement this system and run a series of operations, such as adding a book, listing books, etc.
