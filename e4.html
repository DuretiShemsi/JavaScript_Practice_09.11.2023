        //Exercise #4
//Objective: Familiarize with static methods in classes.
//Add a static method called info() to the Person class. This method should return a statement like, "This is a Person class".
//Try accessing this method both from the class itself and from an instance of the class. Document the outcomes.

class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    static info() {
        return 'This is a Person class';
    }
}
// Accessing the static method from the class itself
console.log(Person.info()); // Output: "This is a Person class"

// Creating an instance of the Person class
const person = new Person('Sara', 30);

// Accessing the static method from an instance of the class
console.log(person.constructor.info()); // Output: "This is a Person class"
