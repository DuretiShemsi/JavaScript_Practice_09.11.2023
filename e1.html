        //Exercise #1
    // Objective: Understand the "this" keyword in different contexts.
//Create three functions: one global, one as an object method, and an arrow function inside an object.
//Print the value of this inside each function.
//Discuss or note down the differences you observe in the value of this across the three scenarios.

//global method

function global() {
    console.log("This in global function :", this);
  }
  
  global();
  
  //In a global function, when we call global(), the this keyword refers to the global object

  //object method

  const myCar = {
    brand: "Nissan",
    drive: function() {
      console.log(`I am driving a ${this.brand} car.`);
    },
  };
  
  myCar.drive(); 

  //In an object method, such as myCar.drive(), the this keyword refers to the object that the method is called on (in this case, myCar)
  

  //Arrow Function
